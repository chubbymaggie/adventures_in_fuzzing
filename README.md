# Info

This was a talk I gave at NYU on 2018-11-13

I talk a bit about fuzzing as a concept for a bit, and then transition to talking about my major personal tools that I developed.

# LFS

This project uses large file support support in Git to handle the >100 MiB audio file. `git lfs install` should install Git LFS, and then cloning this project should "just work". Using the download-as-zip from GitHub will not work for the audio file, but will for the slides.

If you do not have LFS support you still will get the slides but not the audio.
